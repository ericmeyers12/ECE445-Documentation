%SECTION - Introduction
\section{Introduction}
There have been several friendly fire incidents in recorded military history, accounting for an estimated 2\% to 20\% of all casualties in battle\textsuperscript{\cite{USArmy}}. Using attire to identify friend vs enemy is problematic in situations when both sides are clad in the same camouflage pattern, or are obscured by obstacles.

In order to reduce the amount of friendly fire accidents in modern combat, a Infantry I.F.F. (Identification Friend or Foe) will be designed and constructed which will notify a soldier bearing a weapon whether or not their target is friendly.

Several I.F.F. systems exist for aircraft, however not many reliable systems have been constructed to suit infantry.

The system will mount to the side of any weapon, send out queries, ask if a target is friendly, and upon receiving a successful (friendly) reply, will notify the operator.

This will be accomplished through a laser transmission system mounted to the rail (weaver mount) of a weapon. If the friendly personnel receives any of this signal (via phototransistors), it will respond with "acknowledgement" that it is friendly. Once the interrogator receives notice that the target is friendly, the dot sight will turn to a different color.

Encryption plays a large role in a system like this, and for this reason must be emphasized heavily in the design process. Pulse Width Modulation will be used to transmit a unique I.D. of the interrogator pointing their sights at a friendly target, and upon receiving this laser transmission, the target will respond with an RF signal. This RF Isotropic Signal will be encrypted with a passphrase that is generated using a method similar to a "Time-based one-time password" algorithm.

The benefit of a system like this are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reduce number of friendly fire accidents during combat \textsuperscript{\cite{Garrison}}
	\item Reduce number of misfires accidents during combat \textsuperscript{\cite{Garrison}}
	\item Notify friendly personnel location of particular friendly target when aiming
	\item Other applications including but not limited to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Paintball or Airsoft
		\item Arcade Laser Tag
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The cost of a system like this will be heavily emphasized throughout the design phase. The team has proposed a schedule dating from February 8th - May 2nd of this semester. This gives the team $\approx$ 3 weeks for design, $\approx$ 7 weeks to assemble, test, and refine, and $\approx$ 3 weeks to document. The cost and schedule are both expanded upon in Section 5 in this document.\\

%SECTION - Design
\section{Design}
\subsection{Block Diagram}
The design of a system like this is very flexible and can be implemented in several ways. The team decided to break this up into two subsystems with individual sub-components. These will be referred to the "friendly interrogator system" and the "friendly target system". 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Friendly Interrogator System
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Laser Transmission (Transmit Query)
		\item RF Receiver (Receive Acknowledgement)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Friendly Target System
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Photoreceiver (Receive Query)
		\item RF Transmitter (Transmit Acknowledgement)
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Below is a block diagram containing all subsystems that will be designed and constructed this semester. The red dotted line is referring to the Laser Subsystem which is essentially a adjustable laser that will reach the desired distance along with a photodetector to detect these signals. The blue dotted line is the R.F. Subsystem which will serve as the "acknowledgement" to the laser signal to notify the interrogator that the target they are pointing their weapon at is friendly. The green dotted line is referring to the Friendly Interrogator and the Friendly Target Subsystem which will be expanded upon in the following pages.

%SECTION - Requirements and Verification
\section{Requirements and Verification}
The requirements for this semester are as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Power Module - must maintain a constant DC power source of  5.0V $\pm$ 2.0V.
	\item Laser transmitter must transmit a PWM signal with a duty cycle of less than \_\_<insert numerical value here>\_\_ to transmit a unique integer I.D. of the interrogator.
	\item Laser transmitter must be able to span a range that is equivelent to the width of a human chest (2-3 ft) at the following distances:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Short Range (0 - 50 m)
			\item Medium Range (50 - 150 m)
			\item Long Range (150 - 300 m)
		\end{itemize}
	\item Photoreceiver with the ability to detect a PWM signal up to $\approx$300 m of the same wavelength as the laser transmitter. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 90\% $\pm$ 5\% of packets must be detected by photodetector properly
		\end{itemize}
	\item Microcontroller Unit with ability to generate PWM signals through laser transmission and receive R.F. Acknowledgement and process the signal.
	\item Isotropic R.F. signal with a range of $\leq$ 300 m (operating frequency to be determined later).
	\item R.F. receiver with the ability to detect an R.F. signal of $\leq$ 300 m
	\item Encryption - An R.F. signal being transmitted from a friendly target back to the interrogator must contain a clock that is within $\pm$ 10 seconds of the clock that is onboard the interrogator.
	\item Speed - The average human reaction time for visual stimulii is 190 milliseconds [3]. A friendly target at 300 m should be marked friendly within 190 milliseconds so that, to a human user, it seems nearly instantaneous. 
	\item Laser transmitter accuracy - at 300 m, the beam makes contact with the aiming point of the rifle. 
\end{enumerate}

%SECTION - Tolerance Analysis
\section{Tolerance Analysis}
The signal transmission from the friendly interrogator to the friendly target will be a critical aspect of this project. The extremes of this transmission must be tested; ensuring that it has bot the range and signal span required. 

Capturing these requirements, the team must transmit a signal to a photo-detector at the following ranges:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Short Range (0 - 50 m)
			\item Medium Range (50 - 150 m)
			\item Long Range (150 - 300 m)
		\end{itemize}

The team should then verify that the signal was received and processed by the MCU. Furthermore, the team should verify that the signal spans the width of a human chest. More concretely, that a sighted-in laser transmitter can be aimed at any point within 1-1.5 feet of the receiver and still register friendly. 

The team must transmit a signal over a distance of 300 meters that has the ability to be accurately received by a photo-detector and processed by an MCU. 

Test Procedure:
 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mount the receiver 300 m downrange of the transmitter
	\item Aim the laser transmitter directly at the receiver, using a mount (like a vice grip) to keep it stable. 
	\item Verify the signal is received.
	\item Aim and verify the signal is also received when aiming 1.5ft to the right, top, and bottom of the receiver. 
	\item Repeat these steps for 50 m and 150 m. 
\end{itemize}

\hl{Accuracy can be captured by the likelihood of Type I and Type II errors for the system. That is, we can define a Type I error as incorrectly identifying something as friendly, when in fact it was either an inanimate object (or worse) an enemy. A Type II error, then, would mean that the system failed to mark a friendly target as friendly. Type I errors should be greatly mitigated by the encryption system; that is, if an acknowledgment is received and valid, it is impossible that the acknowledgment occurred due to chance. The sources of Type II errors, then, would be a glitches in either the interrogator circuit or the acknowledgment broadcasting circuit. A Type II error, however, could happen for a number reasons; including the laser being interrupted before its identification could be transmitted to the photo-receiver. } I don't know where this belongs but might be useful

\end{figure}


\subsection{Cost}
The following is a rough cost analysis of the project: 

\hl{Eric, I'm gonna need help making a good table!}

Industrial IR Laser - \$13.26 http://www.ebay.com/itm/Industrial-Focusable-50mW-780nm-Infrared-IR-Laser-DOT-Diode-Module-Lazer-/110887862755?hash=item19d16e81e3:g:4akAAOSwxH1ULBEs

8-bit PIC MCU, x2 - Free, from lab? 

PCB - At least 2 at \$33 each 

\hl { should we include estimates for photodiodes or just one big estimate for all sorts of parts like LEDs and stuff?}

\subsection{Labor}
This appears to be a fairly demanding Senior Design project. The team has approximately 12 weeks to design, implement, and fabricate this project. Each member of the team will likely work at least 10 hours a week on the project. This means 120 hours per team member. 

\hl{ we need another chart. Each person worth\$31 an hour, with 120 hours invested makes 120*\$31*2.5 = \$9300per person, makes \$18600 in labor for the project. }
