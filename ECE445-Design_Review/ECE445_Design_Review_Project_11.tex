%SECTION - Introduction
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Statement of Purpose}
There have been several friendly fire incidents in recorded military history, accounting for an estimated 2\% to 20\% of all casualties in battle\textsuperscript{\cite{USArmy}}. Using attire to identify friend vs enemy is problematic in situations when both sides are clad in the same camouflage pattern, or are obscured by obstacles.

The purpose of this project is to create a system that quickly and accurately identifies friendly targets among military personnel on foot. Similar systems exist for aircraft, however not many exist for infantry.

The idea is to develop a two-way communication system so that when a soldier aims their weapon in the direction of a friendly target, they will receive notification through an LED that the target is, indeed, friendly and not an enemy. Throughout this document the infantry unit with the weapon will be referred to the "friendly interrogator" and the target will  be referred to as the "friendly target". 

This communication protocol can be

These inputs and outputs are described below under each block description.

Power-In: N/A \\
Power-Out: Microcontroller Unit (3.3V), Laser Diode (4.8V), R.F. Receiver (4.8V) \\
Input(s): N/A \\
Output(s): N/A

The Power Module will consist of four standard rechargable 1.2V AA NiMH batteries which will provide a voltage of 4.8 when placed in series in a battery pack. This will then feed into a LD1117V33 Voltage Step-Down Regulator to bring the voltage to 3.3V. This 3.3V is necessary to provide the Microcontroller the correct voltage. The voltage regulator will provide a maximum of 900 mA of current which is well sufficient for this project. The schematic for the voltage regulator is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ld1117-voltage-regulator-circuit}.

Depending on the manufacture chosen and the battery model, the batteries will hold a capacity of 1000 mAh to 3000mAh. For budgetary purposes the team will choose the ladder (a battery with a smaller capacity) because this will easily satisfy the requirements of powering the module for minimum of 8 hours. \hl{maybe show calculation???} The friendly interrogator unit will not be drawing much current however there are restraints placed on the current drawn from this battery in order to satisfy the time requirement. A 1000mAh battery will supply a circuit with 125 mA for 8 hours, therefore this unit must not draw more than 125 mA, which will be achievable.

The team decided to use four standard AA 1.2V NiMH rechargable batteries instead of any other standard batteries (such as disposable AAA or AA or a 9V battery) for several reasons. For one, the laser diode (as discussed later on) operates on a voltage from 4.5 - 5.5 voltage and this will satisfy this requirement. Also, the capacity is much higher for AA rechargeable batteries than 9V batteries so therefore the team went with the obvious option of choosing the AA batteries.

\hl{discuss case and mount???} \\
\hl{discuss switch and power-on process? 
	-the friendly target should on at all times once the operator turns it o
	-the friendly interrogator unit should only should turn on when the operator triggers it (i.e. the laser should not be constantly pulsing, it should only be when the interrogator wants to check the target status) - switch would solve this\\

The team chose to work with an T.I. MSP430F2274 Microcontroller Unit \textsuperscript{\cite{MSP430F2274}} due to its compiler simplicity, its availability in the ECE445 Senior Design Labs (inventory) and the number of GPIO Pins on board (compared to other options, this model had several I/O pins and was the most inexpensive). Compared to many other MCUs on the market, the MSP430 is relatively well documented and there exist several support forums on the internet to assist the team throughout the duration of the project.

The board requires a 3.3V power supply which is why the voltage regulator is necessary as stated before.

Please refer to Section \ref{section-functionality} to view in-depth discussion about the functionality of the MSP430F2274 Microcontroller Unit and how it will be used throughout this project.

Output(s): Microcontroller

The Real Time Clock is not entirely necessary for the operation of the Laser Transmitter Subsystem, however it will be necessary for the operation of the R.F. Receiver and thus must be included in the MCU circuit. It will operate using a 32.768 kHz Crystal Oscillator (as recommended by T.I. \textsuperscript{\cite{RTC-Implementation}}) with an accuracy of +/- 20 PPM (deviates between 32.7673 kHz and 32.7687 kHz).

Power-In: \\
Power-Out: \\
Input(s): Microcontroller TTL Input /hl{change}\\
Output(s): 5mW Laser Beam 

The 5mW laser diode will operate on 3.3V at 25mA so a 1.3k$\Omega$ (confirm?) resistor is necessary to drop the current being supplied to the diode down to this threshold. 

Due to safety and ethical considerations, the requirements have changed for the divergence of the beam. The proposal stated a requirement of a 5-6 ft diameter beam at 50, 150, and 300 m (with optical adjustments allowed). This was assuming the team was using a 20mW laser diode which is now not the case (this design choice will  be discussed in both Section \ref{section-safety-ethics} and Section \ref{section-simulations-calculations} as appropriate). Instead the team will be using a 5 mW laser which will produce a beam divergence of 2.5-2.75 feet at \_\_\_\_ feet. 

Again, please refer to Section \ref{section-safety-ethics} and Section \ref{section-simulations-calculations} to view an in-depth discussion about these design choices.

\hl{Do we need any setup procedures?}
This section is to explain the overview of how each part interfaces with another and the protocol used to transmit data from both the friendly interrogator unit to the friendly target unit. The below diagram is a flowchart representing the flow of events that occur to identify a target as friendly. Each individual label will be explained in extensive detail below.

\subsection{Numerical Analysis and Simulations/Plots} \label{section-simulations-calculations}

\subsubsection{Calculations}

\normalsize\textbf{Laser Diode} \\
With some tolerance, the PIN photodiode used in the friendly target system can register an irradiance of 9 $\frac{W}{m^2}$. The laser required to achieve this irradiance is a function of the laser power and the radius of the beam. With relatively short distances of 0-300 m, atmospheric deflection of light is negligible. 

Using trigonometry, the power as a function of radius is given by $P = \pi r^2  E_{req} $, where $r$ is the radius (in meters) and $E_{req}$ is the required irradiance of 9 $\frac{W}{m^2}$. 

For a diameter equal to the one stated in the proposal ($\approx 1.6764 m$), a $\pi (0.8382)^2(9) \approx 20 mW$ laser is needed. A $20 mW$ laser is a Class 3B laser, and is considered dangerous. For the scope of this senior design project, a $5mW$ laser will be used instead. 

The radius achieved using a $5 mW$ laser is given by $\sqrt{\frac{P}{E_{req} \pi}} = 0.420522 m$. This is approximately a $2.75 ft$ diameter beam, which is still the size of a person's chest.

\subsection{Tolerance Analysis}
\hl{NEED TO INCLUDE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS-\\
	Tolerance analysis is part of the DESIGN process. The tolerance analysis is not an experiment to see what the limits of your project are after it has been designed and built. The tolerance analysis is an exercise in working backwards from what your goal is, and then figuring out how precise a specific hardware component must be. "We will stress the device until it no longer works as intended and look at the results" is not a tolerance analysis. "Given that we have a goal of X, The accuracy of component Y must be Z to achieve X properly" is a tolerance analysis. It should involve math and design equations. For example, in amplifier design there is usually a bias circuit that includes a resistor network. Resistor values in real life are not exact and have an advertised tolerance (10\%, 5\%, 1\%). Find how accurate your resistors must be to meet your gain or bandwidth requirements in the worst case scenario. If it is lower than 10\%, you have just concluded that your design will require parts with a tighter tolerance.}

\subsection{Safety} \label{section-safety-ethics}
\normalsize\textbf{Laser Diode} \\
As stated previously, the proposal requirements would have required a $20mW$ IR laser. However, in the State of Illinois, a 20mW laser is considered a Class 3B laser and must be registered with the Division of Nuclear Safety in the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. This would have required the team to file the correct paperwork and pay a registration fee of \$50. This paperwork would have likely caused delays in receiving parts and construction of this project. A 20 mW laser would have also needed much more pre-caution and safety mitigations than a much less powerful laser.

For the reasons stated above, the team will instead use a $5mW$ visible red laser. $5mW$ visible lasers have a low chance of injuring the eye, as the blinking reflex will save a victim from permanent damage; as opposed to IR lasers which can go unnoticed for several seconds. 

The following is a calculation for the nominal ocular hazard distance (NOHD) of our laser, as defined by the ANSI Standard \cite{ANSI}.

The maximum permissible exposure (MPE), as defined by the ANSI Standard \cite{ANSI} is the highest power or energy density of a light source that is considered safe, i.e. that has a negligible probability for creating damage. This MPE for a pulsing laser is calculated as the minimum of the following three rules:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Any single pulse in the train must not exceed the MPE for the pulse exposure time.
	\item The exposure from any group of pulses delivered in time T must not exceed the MPE for
	time T, where T is 0.25 seconds (from the blinking reflex), for a visible laser. 
	\item For thermal injury, the exposure for any single pulse within a group of pulses must not
	exceed the single-pulse MPE multiplied by a multiple-pulse correction factor
\end{enumerate}

The laser will pulse at a rate of 40 kHz. Assuming at most a 50\% duty cycle, each pulse will be of max length $1.25*10^{-5} s$. The divergence of the beam is smallest for the longest range; a lower divergence is more restrictive in terms of safety, so this calculation uses $300m$. The divergence of the beam for 300m is 2.79 mrad and the beam waist is approximately $4 mm$. \\

Following the ANSI Standard \cite{ANSI}, the Rule 1 calculation is 

{\large $5*10^{-3}*(\frac{2.79}{1.5})  = 0.0093 \frac{J}{m^2}$ }\\

The Rule 2 calculation is

{\large $\frac{18(.25^{0.75})(\frac{2.79}{1.5})}{.25*40000} = 0.0011837 \frac{J}{m^2}$ }\\

The Rule 3 calculation is

{\large $(.25*40000)^{0.25} * 5*10^{-3}*(\frac{2.79}{1.5}) = 0.093 \frac{J}{m^2}$ }\\

The most restrictive of all the rules is Rule 2, which gives us an MPE of $0.0011837 \frac{J}{m^2}$.

At $5mW$ with a pulse width of $1.25*10^{-5}$, the power of the laser is $6.25*10^{-8} J$. 

The NOHD is defined as

{\LARGE $ \frac{\sqrt{\frac{4 * P}{\pi * MPE}} - 2w}{\theta}$}

Where P is the power of the beam ($6.25*10^{-8} J$) and $w$ is the waist of the beam ($1mm$). This gives an NOHD of 

{\Large$ \frac{\sqrt{\frac{4 * 6.25*10^{-8}}{\pi * 0.0011837}} - 2(0.004)}{0.00279} = 0.0713 m $}

The team will avoid eye damage by not working with their eyes inside of 8 cm from the laser. If it is necessary to get this close to the laser, the team will wear eye protection or simply power off the laser.
